    <h2>by Frank Ziemlinski</h2>

    <p>Mike: [Frank] was never a part of the Piranha team. At that time he was working in a company that was in the same building as us. He was jointly responsible for the *Moorhuhn* (*Crazy Chicken*). That was done by Frank Ziemlinksi, among others. And occasionally he just was a bit bored and then he scribbled a little bit for Gothic, of his own accord. And now and then he handed something in.</p>

    <h3>Morlocks</h3>

    <p>The creatures drawn by Frank can not be clearly differentiated into different species. Most of the above were supposed to be orcs (called Morlocks at the time); but we don't know if all of them were meant to be or if some of them were meant to be different kinds of creatures like ogers or trolls. But it has to be understood that it is on purpose that these creatures, while being Morlocks, look very differently from each other. The Morlocks are a mixture of different, deformed, mutated creatures, perceived as monsters being banned from society. On Mikes <a href="{{ imagesRoot }}/conceptart/mikehoge/maps/map1.jpg">first map sketch</a> they were meant to live in a deep forest in the south of the sect camp.</p>
