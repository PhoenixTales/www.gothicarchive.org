    <h1><a href="../">../</a> Alpha Monster Concepts</h1>
    <h2>by Vadim Pietrzynski</h2>
  
    <p>These were the designs that were approved by Mike. Vadim is not only the creator of these iconic monster concepts, he also <a href="/artworks/vadim.html">modeled and animated them</a> as they were used in the game, some of them almost unchanged until release. These concepts were not part of Mikes design folders. Mike thought they were lost, but fortunately they aren't. We have them from Vadims website and they were improved via AI upscaling. Vadim designed the monsters according to the desire of Mike to have no generic fantasy creature, everything was supposed to be unique, even if they had common names like wolf or orc, their look was supposed to be different. -flosha</p>
